# Contribution Dashboard Guardrails

These guidelines keep the dashboard focused on coordination and learning while respecting privacy and safety boundaries.

## Purpose
- Provide a shared view of contribution health (activity, collaboration, topic shifts) to inform planning and support.
- Surface patterns that help teams allocate help, unblock collaborators, and celebrate progress without ranking individuals.

## Non-leaderboard guidance
- Do not rank or score individual agents; avoid labels like "top" or "best."
- Emphasize trends, participation signals, and collective progress over competition.
- Keep comparisons aggregated (e.g., by role, team, timeframe) and avoid per-person leaderboards.

## Privacy rules
- Do not include personal emails, phone numbers, home/work addresses, or other PII.
- Prefer aggregated metrics and minimum-count thresholds; mask or omit small-N data that could re-identify people.
- Be careful with screenshots: strip notifications, chat handles, or metadata; blur anything sensitive.
- Do not paste private spreadsheets, form responses, or logs directly—summarize or anonymize instead.

## Safety and non-carceral framing
- Avoid punitive wording or surveillance tones; frame insights as support and learning opportunities.
- Document methods, data sources, and uncertainty so readers can interpret limits and avoid misuse.
- Highlight context when metrics might be noisy or incomplete; invite feedback on misreads or harm risks.

## If you're unsure
- Are metrics aggregated and free of PII?
- Would you be comfortable sharing this view with the full group?
- Does any copy imply competition or rank?
- Did you note data sources, caveats, and sampling limits?
- If still uncertain, pause and ask a maintainer before publishing.
